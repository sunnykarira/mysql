COMMON DATA TYPES

Numeric INT, TINYINT, BIGINT, FLOAT
String VARCHAR, TEXT (65000 chars limit and therefore we have long text), CHAR
Dates DATE, DATETIME, TIMESTAMP
Other BINARY, JSON

There is no boolean in mysql, there we use 0/1 and that is TINYINT.


Relational DB => You can relate data to each other.

Primary Key -> Unique identifier in table.
Orders table (id) is foreign key and is primary key(id) in users table.


Orders Table (id, user_id, status, created_at)
Users Table (id, full_name, email, gender, date_of_birth, country_code, created_at)



Create a new user to access the DB.
CREATE USER 'yourname'@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'password';

SELECT user, host FROM mysql.user;

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON * . * TO 'username'@localhost;

FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
